   Classification
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Identifying which category a time series belong to.

   **Algorithms**: Random shapelet forest, Extra shapelet trees and ROCKET.

   ---

   Regression
   ^^^^^^^^^^

   Predicting a continuous-valued attribute associated with a time series.

   **Algorithms**: Random shapelet forest, Extra shapelet trees and ROCKET.

   ---

   Counterfactuals
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Explaining time series classifiers by counterfactual reasoning.

   **Algorithms**: Shapelet forest counterfactuals, KNearest counterfactuals and
   Prototype counterfactuals.


   ---

   Unsupervised
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Identify interesting regions, motifs or outlier in time series. Or embed time series
   using various features.

   **Algorithms**: MatrixProfile, Isolation shapelet forests and Shapelet, ROCKET, and
   interval embeddings.
